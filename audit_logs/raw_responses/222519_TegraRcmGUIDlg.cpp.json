    "description": "The StartTimer function sets a timer that triggers every second. If the LookUp method is not properly implemented to handle potential errors or unexpected behavior, it could lead to security vulnerabilities such as resource exhaustion or unauthorized access.",
    "fix": "Ensure that the LookUp method includes proper error handling and validation of inputs. Consider implementing rate limiting or other safeguards to prevent abuse of this timer functionality."
