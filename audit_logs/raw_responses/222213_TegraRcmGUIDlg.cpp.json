    "description": "The function GetModuleFileName is used to retrieve the fully qualified path for the executable that contains the specified module. If the buffer provided (szPath) is not large enough to hold the returned string, it can lead to a buffer overflow.",
    "fix": "Ensure that the buffer size passed to GetModuleFileName is sufficient to accommodate the longest possible file path. Consider using _MAX_PATH as defined in windows.h, which is typically 260 characters."
