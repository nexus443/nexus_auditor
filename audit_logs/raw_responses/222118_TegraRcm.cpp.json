    "description": "The function GetAbsolutePath is used to retrieve the absolute path of a file. However, there is no check on the length of the returned path, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the path exceeds the allocated buffer size.",
    "fix": "Ensure that the buffer size for storing the path is sufficient and add checks to handle cases where the path might be longer than expected."
