    "title": "Potential Security Vulnerability in Timer Handling",
    "severity": "Medium",
    "line": 27,
    "description": "The OnTimer function is called every second to execute m_TegraRcm->LookUp(). If this function performs any operations that could be exploited, such as file I/O or network communication, it could lead to a security vulnerability. Additionally, the timer is not stopped in certain conditions, which might cause unexpected behavior.",
    "fix": "Review the implementation of m_TegraRcm->LookUp() to ensure it does not introduce any security risks. Consider adding checks and proper error handling within this function. Also, ensure that the timer is properly managed and stopped when no longer needed."
