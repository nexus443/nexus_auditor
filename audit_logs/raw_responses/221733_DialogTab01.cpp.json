    "description": "The command string 'cmd' is constructed using lstrcat without checking the length of the input strings. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the payload file path exceeds MAX_PATH characters.",
    "fix": "Use safer string handling functions such as _snwprintf_s or std::wstring to construct the command string."
