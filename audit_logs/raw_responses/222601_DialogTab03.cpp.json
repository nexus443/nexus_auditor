    "line": 136,
    "description": "The function SHGetFolderPath is used to retrieve the path of a special folder, but it does not check if the buffer provided is large enough. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the path exceeds MAX_PATH characters.",
    "fix": "Use the newer SHGetKnownFolderPath function which provides a way to specify the size of the buffer and returns the actual length of the path."
