    "description": "The code constructs command strings using user input without proper validation or sanitization, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.",
    "fix": "Validate and sanitize all user inputs before constructing command strings. Use parameterized commands or APIs that prevent command execution through string manipulation.",

    "confidence": 90,
    "reasoning": {
        "pattern": "The code uses `_tcscpy_s` to copy user input into a buffer without validation, which can lead to command injection if the input contains malicious characters.",
        "cve_refs": ["CVE-2014-6271"],
        "exploit_example": "An attacker could provide a specially crafted input that includes shell metacharacters (e.g., `; rm -rf /`) to execute arbitrary commands on the system."
