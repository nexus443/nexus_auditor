    "title": "Buffer Overflow in writeSingleBuffer",
    "severity": "High",
    "line": 165,
    "description": "The function `writeSingleBuffer` writes data to a USB device without checking if the provided buffer size exceeds the maximum packet size. This can lead to a buffer overflow.",
    "fix": "Add a check to ensure that the data length does not exceed the maximum packet size before writing it to the device.",
    "type": "Buffer Overflow",
    "confidence": 85,
    "reasoning": {
        "pattern": "memcpy overflow",
        "cve_refs": ["CVE-2014-9322"],
        "exploit_example": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a large data buffer that exceeds the maximum packet size, causing the device to write beyond its allocated memory. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or other malicious actions."
