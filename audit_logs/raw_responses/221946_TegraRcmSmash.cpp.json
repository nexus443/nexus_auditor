    "line": 127,
    "description": "The function readDeviceId does not check if the input buffer size is less than the expected device ID size (0x10 bytes). If a smaller buffer is passed, it could lead to a buffer overflow.",
    "fix": "Add a check at the beginning of the readDeviceId function to ensure that outBufSize is at least 0x10 before proceeding with the read operation."
