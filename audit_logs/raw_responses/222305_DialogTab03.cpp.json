    "severity": "High",
    "line": 123,
    "description": "The function SHGetFolderPath is used to retrieve the path of a special folder, but it does not check if the buffer provided (szPath) is large enough. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the path length exceeds MAX_PATH.",
    "fix": "Use the newer SHGetKnownFolderPath function which provides better handling for longer paths and returns a pointer to a string that must be freed with CoTaskMemFree."
