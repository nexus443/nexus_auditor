    "severity": "High",
    "line": 162,
    "description": "The function StringCchCopy is used to copy strings, but it does not check if the destination buffer size is sufficient. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the source string is longer than the destination buffer.",
    "fix": "Ensure that the destination buffer size is checked before using StringCchCopy. Use safer functions like _tcscpy_s or strncpy_s which include bounds checking."
