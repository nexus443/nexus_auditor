    "description": "The function `writeSingleBuffer` does not validate the size of the input data before writing it to the USB device. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input data exceeds the buffer size.",
    "fix": "Add validation to ensure that the input data length does not exceed the buffer size.",

        "exploit_example": "An attacker can craft a malicious input data that exceeds the buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code."
